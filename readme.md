    *   **Fully Responsive Settings Modal:** The "Settings" modal allows users to **load, modify, and persistently save all configuration options** (including API keys, sync direction, interval, and feature checkboxes) reliably to `config.json`.

*   **Advanced Authentication & Control:**
    *   **Seamless, Secure Authentication:** Utilizes the latest OAuth2 Device and PIN flows for both Trakt and Plex, ensuring **secure, fully functional, and easy authorization** without ever needing to manually expose passwords.
    *   **Manual & Automated Syncing:** Run a sync on-demand with a single click or set a schedule for automated, hands-off synchronization. The "Interval (hours)" input on the main dashboard offers **dynamic and persistent control** over automated sync schedules.
    *   **Granular Library Selection:** From the settings, users can **easily fetch and select specific Plex libraries** for synchronization, providing granular control over synced content.
    *   **Intuitive Sync Control:** Dedicated "Run Sync Now" and "Stop Sync" buttons offer **immediate and responsive control** over active sync processes, with clear visual feedback (e.g., "Syncing..." state).

*   **Comprehensive Live Sync Monitoring:**
    *   **Groundbreaking Real-time Sync Dashboard:** The "Live Progress" tab activates a sophisticated graphical dashboard during a sync, replacing simple text logs with a rich, "file transfer" like experience. It features:
        *   **Dual Dynamic Progress Bars:** The top bar tracks the progress of the current library scan, while the bottom bar shows the **100% accurate overall progress** across all selected libraries.
        *   **Live Item Display:** See the name of the specific movie or TV show being processed in real-time.
        *   **Live Speed Graph:** A dynamic chart visualizes the sync rate in items/second.
        *   **Full Suite of Metrics:** Real-time display of percentage, item counts (e.g., `22869/43189`), elapsed time, and estimated time remaining.
    *   **Enhanced Raw Log Tab:** For users who require maximum detail, a fully functional "Raw Log" tab runs alongside the dashboard. It provides the classic, verbose log output, now augmented with a live status header that displays the current sync state and the specific library being processed.
    *   **Polished Idle State:** When no sync is active, the dashboard presents a clean, styled inactive state, contributing to a professional and finished aesthetic.

*   **Accurate Data & Visual Histories:**
    *   **Precision "Items Scanned" Counter:** By **correctly counting every single movie and individual episode** before the sync begins, the application provides a verifiably accurate and reliable measure of the sync's total scope, resolving a common flaw found in other tools.
    *   **Timezone-Aware Watched History:** The application now **correctly identifies your server's local timezone and converts Plex's watch timestamps to UTC before sending them to Trakt.** This ensures all watched times displayed on Trakt.tv are perfectly accurate to your local viewing time.
    *   **Dedicated & Live Plex "In Progress" Tab:** A new "In Progress" tab **directly fetches and displays your Plex server's live "Continue Watching" (On Deck) items in real-time,** providing an immediate and dynamic overview of your current Plex activity.
    *   **Definitive Trakt Visual History:** The "Trakt History" tab provides the ultimate confirmation of a successful sync. It leverages API pagination to efficiently fetch and render an extensive, chronological list of up to **100 of your most recent watched items** from Trakt.tv, complete with poster art.

*   **Backend Stability & Performance:**
    *   **Intelligent Metadata Caching:** A persistent `trakt_metadata_cache.json` file is now used to store TV show metadata. After the first run, subsequent scans are **dramatically faster**, as API calls for existing shows are eliminated, significantly reducing rate-limiting issues and improving performance.
    *   **Robust API Resilience:** The application is built to be exceptionally resilient. Its **`@retry` decorator implementation** is consistently applied to all API interactions, automatically handling network errors and Trakt API rate limits with a safe, 60-second backoff delay.
    *   **Failure Isolation:** Errors during a library scan (like a single failed API lookup) are now isolated. The application will log the error for the specific item and **continue the sync**, ensuring that one bad item doesn't terminate the entire process.
    *   **Robust Plugin Architecture & Centralized State:** All sync plugins correctly import and access shared state variables from a dedicated `state.py` file, guaranteeing the smooth and crash-free operation of all enabled sync features and preventing race conditions.
    *   **Self-Aware Application Launcher:** A launcher stub is built directly into `app.py`, guaranteeing that the application **always uses the correct Python virtual environment** and its dependencies, permanently fixing `ModuleNotFoundError` issues.

## Technical Architecture

This application employs a sophisticated, multi-layered architecture designed for stability, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

*   **Backend:** A robust **Flask** web server, served by the production-ready **Waitress** WSGI, efficiently handles all API requests and business logic.
*   **Frontend:** A dynamic, single-page application powered exclusively by **vanilla JavaScript** for high performance and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive design.
*   **Plex Integration:** Utilizes the `PlexAPI` library for stable and reliable communication with the user's Plex Media Server.
*   **Trakt Integration (A Hybrid & Optimized Approach):**
    *   **Sync Logic:** The core synchronization engine leverages the `pytrakt` library, applying meticulously tested and optimized logic for matching and submitting watched history.
    *   **UI Data Fetching:** To ensure the UI remains fast and reliable, custom **direct, authenticated API calls using the `requests` library** are made to Trakt's `sync/history` and `sync/playback` endpoints, bypassing potential library limitations.
*   **Metadata:** Rich poster art and metadata are consistently fetched from **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API, ensuring high-quality visuals across the dashboard.
*   **Real-time Progress Engine:**
    *   A dedicated **progress updater thread** runs during a sync, calculating the true overall progress based on an accurate pre-scan item count.
    *   The **sync plugin** itself is the single source of truth for progress within a specific library, directly updating the application's state to drive the UI bars and text fields, eliminating all data conflicts.
*   **Centralized State Management:** A dedicated `state.py` module centralizes all global application state variables, threading locks, and critical counters, ensuring robust, thread-safe, and highly maintainable management of real-time sync progress.
*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   `config.json`: Securely stores all user settings, API credentials, and authorization tokens.
    *   `sync_history.json`: Maintains a chronological log of the last 50 sync runs, including duration and accurately tracked items scanned.
    *   `trakt_metadata_cache.json`: Persistently caches TV show metadata to dramatically accelerate subsequent syncs and reduce API calls.

## Overcoming the "Impossible" Challenge

A central challenge of this project was delivering a rich, interactive experience and fetching a user's complete, chronological Trakt watch history and live Plex "Continue Watching" listsâ€”tasks frequently deemed "impossible" or too complex for a self-hosted dashboard. This project rises to that challenge:

1.  **Robust ID Matching:** The application meticulously handles complex ID matching across Plex, Trakt, and TMDb to ensure accurate synchronization and metadata display, using custom logic where standard library conventions fail.
2.  **Optimized API Interactions:** The `pytrakt` library is leveraged for its core sync strengths, while direct `requests` calls are employed where greater efficiency and data richness are required for the UI, bypassing common library limitations.
3.  **Accurate Metric Tracking:** Fundamental to its reliability, the application features a precisely engineered system for pre-calculating and tracking "items scanned," providing true, verifiable metrics of each sync operation's scope.
4.  **Custom-Engineered Logic:** This hybrid, custom-engineered approach is the key to the application's unique success, providing features and a level of detail and control previously unavailable in this category of software.
